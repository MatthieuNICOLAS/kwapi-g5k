Power configuration examples
============================

Here you can find multiple examples of driver configuration for Kwapi

1 PDU 2 nodes
-------------

2 nodes connected to 1 PDU.

.. image:: ../graphs/1pdu2nodes.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/1pdu2nodes.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

1 PDU, 1 node, multiple PSU
---------------------------

1 Node with 2 PSU (Power Supply Unit) connected to 1 PDU.

.. image:: ../graphs/1pdu1node_multi.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/1pdu1node_multi.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

1 PDU, shared measure, 2 nodes 
------------------------------

2 nodes connected to a non-monitorable PDU. The non-monitorable PDU in red is connected to a monitorable PDU.
It is equivalent to a shared consumption measure for the 2 nodes.

.. image:: ../graphs/1pdu2nodes_shared.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/1pdu2nodes_shared.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

2 PDU, 1 node, 2 PSU 
--------------------

1 node with 2 PSU connected to 2 different PDU.

.. image:: ../graphs/2pdu1node_multi.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/2pdu1node_multi.conf

Network configuration examples
==============================

1 Switch 2 nodes
----------------

2 nodes connected to 1 switch.

.. image:: ../graphs/1switch2nodes.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/1switch2nodes.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

1 Switch, 1 node, multiple network interfaces
---------------------------------------------

1 Node with 2 network interfaces (eth0 and eth1) connected to 1 switch.

.. image:: ../graphs/1switch1node_multi.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/1switch1node_multi.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

1 switch, shared measure, 2 nodes 
---------------------------------

2 nodes connected to a non-monitorable switch. The non-monitorable switch in red is connected to a monitorable switch in green.
It is equivalent to a shared bandwitch measure for the 2 nodes.

.. image:: ../graphs/1switch2nodes_shared.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/1switch2nodes_shared.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

2 switches, 1 node, 2 network interfaces 
----------------------------------------

1 node with 2 network interfaces connected to 2 different switches.

.. image:: ../graphs/2switch1node_multi.png
.. literalinclude:: ../graphs/2switch1node_multi.conf
  :caption: drivers.conf

2 switches interlink
--------------------

2 switches are connected to each other.
