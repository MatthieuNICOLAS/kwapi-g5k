Installing
==========

Installing Kwapi from source
============================

1. Clone the Kwapi git repository to the management server::

   $ git clone https://github.com/grid5000/kwapi-g5k.git

2. Data management use numpy, which cannot be installed vi pip. On Debian/Ubuntu, use:
   
   $ apt-get install python-numpy

3. Run the Kwapi installer and copy the configuration files::

   $ pip install kwapi-g5k
   $ cp -r kwapi-g5k/etc/kwapi /etc/


Installing Kwapi on Grid'5000
=============================

1. Create a VM on the site you want to monitor. You can create a domU with Xen or KVM. The command should be similar to this one::
   
   $ xen-create-image --hostname=kwapi --ip=ip_address --dist jessie --role=udev
   
   You can find more informations about this procedure here: `<https://www.grid5000.fr/w/TechTeam:Puppet_4_admin>`_

2. Start your VM::
   
   $ xm create /etc/xen/kwapi.cfg

3. Install configuration tool on the VM. Puppet manifests and files are available (soon) in **grid5000-puppet** on INRIA Gitlab. You must install the right version of Puppet used in Grid'5000. Installation procedure can be find here: `Puppet <https://www.grid5000.fr/w/TechTeam:Puppet_4_admin>`_. After the certificate signing procedure, you should have a new Puppet node named **kwapi.site.grid5000.fr**.

4. Configure Kwapi with Puppet. You have to add additional classes on your new Puppet node. Use hiera YAML file to add **grid5000::kwapi** class on the node.

5. Test your new feature on the VM::

   $ rake feature:test host=kwapi.site

6. Your VM is now configured with latest Grid'5000 version of Kwapi. You can connect on the node to check Kwapi service status.::

   $ ssh kwapi.site.g5kadmin
   $ sudo service kwapi status


Running Kwapi modules as daemon
===============================

Kwapi can be started, stoped, restarted with the service command::

   $ sudo service kwapi start|stop|restart

This command will start kwapi as a daemon and run the modules indicated in ``/etc/kwapi/daemon.conf`` file.

Running Kwapi modules in foreground (debugging)
===============================================
   
If you want to manage each Kwapi module individually (drivers and plugins), you can run the following commands.

* Start the drivers on all the configured machines::

   $ kwapi-drivers

* Start the forwarder on this machine and a remote machine (optional)::

   $ kwapi-forwarder

* Start the API plugin if you want to access metrics with the API::

   $ kwapi-api

* Start the RRD plugin if you want to store data as RRD (mandatory to display graphs in a web browser)::

   $ kwapi-rrd

* Start the HDF5 plugin if you want to store fine grained datas::

  $ kwapi-hdf5

* Start Live plugin to active Web visualisation of your mesures::

  $ kwapi-live

* Start Ganglia plugin to push data to the remote Ganglia server::

  $ kwapi-ganglia

.. warning:: Don't forget to **stop** Kwapi daemon service before activating modules in foreground or it will result on conflict problems and data corruption !
