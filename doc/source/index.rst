===========================================
Welcome to Kwapi's developer documentation!
===========================================

Kwapi is a framework designed for acquiring energy consumption and network metrics. It
allows to import metrics from various sources and expose them in different ways.

Its architecture is based on a layer of drivers, which retrieve measurements
from wattmeters or network switches, and a layer of plugins that collect and process them. The
communication between these two layers goes through a bus. In the case of a
distributed architecture, a plugin can listen to several drivers at remote
locations.

Drivers and plugins are easily extensible to support other types of sources,
and provide other services and metrics.

What is the purpose of the project and vision for it?
=====================================================

Kwapi could be used to do:
  * Energy monitoring of data centers
  * Usage-based billing
  * Efficient scheduling
  * Network traffic visualisation
  * Long-term storage of measurements

It aims at supporting various wattmeters and switches, being scalable and easily extensible.

This documentation offers information on how Kwapi works and how to contribute
to the project.
